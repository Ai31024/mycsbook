        I remember the days when our flames were bright red.<br />
        You made a promise to me, and I made a promise to you.<br />
        We will never be apart.<br />
        I need you again to make me believe in it.<br />
        Will you?<br />
        <br />
        We dreamt of a future where we were happy together.<br />
        Tell me that we had the same dream.<br />
        Or was I dreaming alone?<br />
        Please give me a sign, because I'm lost and confused.<br />
        Will you?<br />
        <br />
        You accepted me for who I was, and it felt so good.<br />
        But my faith is now shakenâ€”maybe it was all a lie.<br />
        I feel forsaken.<br />
        Make me feel like I still have space in your heart.<br />
        Will you?<br />
        <br />
        I know we are not meant for each other, but it won't hurt to try.<br />
        For the sake of old times, even though they were not quite right,.<br />
        But for the moments that we wished could just stay forever,.<br />
        <br />
        Could you make me believe again?<br />
        If you can, then<br />
        Can you?<br />
        <br />
