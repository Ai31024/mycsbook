Variable Scope & Data Types

Variables, scopes:

A Variable is a container to hold data 
primarily these are : 
    1. int : integer, i.e., 0, 1, 2... 9 or 23, 334, 55332
    2. float : Float, i.e., 0.1, 2.3, 22.7
    3. char : Character, i.e., a to z or A to Z
    4. double : Double float, i.e., 5.4432223 etc.
    5. bool : Boolean, i.e., True (1) or False (0)

eg: > int sum = 34 ; This means, the term called "sum" is an integer which holds value 34 in the memory.

Based on scope, variable can be classified into two types: 1. Local Variables 2. Global Variables

Scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid.
Local Variable : Local variables are declared inside the braces of any function and can be accessed only from there.
Global Variable : Global variables are declared outside any function and can be accessed from anywhere.
Global and Local variable can have same name.

calling a variable inside a function always prefers the local variable.
-----------------------
Data Types:

Data Types define the type of data a variable can hold, for example an integer variable can hold integer data, a Character type variable can hold Character data etc.

Data Types in Cpp are categorised in three group:
1. Build-in. 
2. User-Defined.
3. Derived.

Rules to declare variables in c++:
    1. Variable names in c++ can range from 1 to 255 characters.
    2. All variable names must begin with a letter of the alphabet or an underscore.
    3. After the first initial letter, variable names can also contain letters and numbers.
    4. Variable names are case sensitive.
    5. No space or special characters are allowed.
    6. You cannot use a C++ reserved keywords as a variable name.
-----------------------
Basic i/o in c++:

<< is called Insertion operator.
>> is called Extraction operator.

cout is "console out"
cin is "console in"

-----------------------
Header files & Operators:

There are 2 type of header files.

    1. System header files: It comes with the compiler
    2. User defined header files : It is written by the programmer.

during this course I created an empty header file called "myheader.h"

Common operators in C++:

    1. Arithmetic Operators : +, -, /, *, %, etc.
    2. Assignment Operators : =
    3. Comparision Operators : <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=, etc.
    4. Logical Operators : &&, ||, !(bool), etc.
    5. Increment and decrement operators : i++, i--, ++i, --i, i+=n, i-=n, etc.
----------------------

Reference variables & Typecasting:

Reference variables means that one variable can be called using different names. To make a different name refer to a perticular variable, we should use (&) sign before it.
i.e.,
    int a = 10;
    int &b = a;
after doing this, when we call "b" using "cout<<b<<endl;" that will print out value of a.
Because "b" became a different name for calling "a". Here, "b" refers to "a".

TypeCasting means to convert one type of datatype into another type of datatype.
----------------------

Constants, Manipulators & Operator precedence:

Constants are just read only variables. Once they are written then that cannot change. written as "const".

Manipulators are text modifiers that modifies the output texts. e.g., endl, setw(this is in iomanip header file), etc.

operator precedence describes the order of priority or associativity on which the operator is going to execute.
----------------------

if-else & control structures:

control structure gives flow and logic to a program.

types of basic control structure:
    1. Sequence structure
    2. Selection structure
    3. Loop structure

Sequence structure : Entry -> Action 1 -> Action 2 -> Exit.

Selection structure : Entry -> condition 1 -> Action 1 or else Action 2 -> Exit.

Loop structure : Entry -> condition 1 -> Action 1 repeats till condition 1 is differed then Action 2 -> Exit.

if-else, elif and switch case statement is shown as in code6.cpp.

----------------------

for, while and do-while loops in C++:

loops in C++:
    There are 3 types of loops in C++:
        1. For loop
        2. While loop
        3. Do-while loop

difference between for loop, while loop and do-while loop.

----------------------

Break and continue:

"break" function breaks and exits the loop chain if the related condition becomes true. Some loop function syntax may atleast run or print the code related to break function once.
"continue" function skips the loop code if the related condition becomes true and continues to run rest of the loop chain.
----------------------

Pointers in C++: pointer (indicated using star *) is a type of datatype that holds the address of other datatypes. Here, "reference in C++ (i.e., &)" is needed for better understanding. 

& means 'Address of' operator.
* means 'Dereference' operator.

pointers are used to store the address of other datatype in the computer's memory. It reserves the address of that datatype until program exits.

To see the memory address in which the other datatype is stored, here is an example:
    int a = 1;
    int* b = &a;
    cout<<b<<endl;
This will return an address of the memory in which interger "a" is stored.

If we want to see address of a datatype but without using pointer variable, then we can do as following example:
    int a = 1;
    cout<<&a<<endl;
By doing this we cannot store the address of variable "a" but we can only see it.
