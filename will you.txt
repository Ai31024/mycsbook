Will you?
-By Azam

I remember the days when our flames were bright red.
You made a promise to me, and I made a promise to you.
We will never be apart.
I need you again to make me believe in it.
Will you?

We dreamt of a future where we were happy together.
Tell me that we had the same dream.
Or was I dreaming alone?
Please give me a sign, because I'm lost and confused.
Will you?

You accepted me for who I was and felt so good.
But my faith is now shakenâ€”maybe it was all a lie.
I feel forsaken.
Make me feel like I still have space in your heart.
Will you?

I know we are not meant for each other, but it won't hurt to try.
For the sake of old times, even though they were not quite right,.
But for the moments that we wished could just stay forever,.

Could you make me believe again?
If you can, then
Can you?
